# network-design-for-a-3-star-Hotel
A proposed network architecture for a 3 star hotel demonstrated using cisco packet tracer.

The 3-star hotel support 10 computers in each floor and the hotel has a total of 15 floors. The hotel has 15 staffs in the hotel management so 15 desktop computers would be required for management department. So, 165 desktop computers would be required. All the computers should have an antivirus software to secure all the computers. The guest computers will be connected to the Primary Router whereas the staff computers will be connected to Staff Router in order to provide different network for guests and staffs. So, we require a total of 2 routers.

To connect those computers with internet connection will need one switch for each floor. All switches are linked to the primary router so we need 15 Switches in total for the guest computers and we require two more switches, one to connect all the staff computers to Staff Router and one to connect the Wireless Repeater to ADSL. So, 17 switches would be required.

The Lobby and Swimming Pool area will be supported with wireless internet facility. To have a better bandwidth weâ€™ll repeat the signal of the wireless access point from primary router by wireless repeater. All the wireless connection supported with WAP/WAP2PSK protection to be secure.
